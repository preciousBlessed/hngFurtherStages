## Introduction

This is a simple CRUD API implementation with nodejs and express. It is intended to serve as the second stage task for the HNG X internship program. This is basically a REST API capable of CRUD operations on a "person" resource, interfacing with the MongoDB (whether local or on MongoBD Atlas). This API can dynamically handle parameters, such as adding or retrieving a person by name. The development is accompanied with a simple UML diagram to represent your system's design and database structure.

## Request and Response Formats

Requests are made to the `/` route of the base url which is be `hostname:port/api`.
